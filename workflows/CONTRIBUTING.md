# How to contribute

This project is a small project for people to get customized data from csv files from scouting for frc teams. This project is open for others to help improve it by proposing features, finding bugs, or fixing  mistakes.

To make it as easy as possible for you to contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of unnecessary work or disappointment. And of course, this document is subject to discussion, so please [create an issue](https://github.com/Neo-Aditya-s-personal-projects/ScoutRadioz-Data-Calculation/issues/new/choose) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!

## Private reports

Usually, all issues are tracked publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Neo-Aditya-s-personal-projects/ScoutRadioz-Data-Calculation/issues). If you want to make a private report (e.g., for a vulnerability or to attach an example that is not meant to be published), please send an email to <hebbaradi6@gmail.com>.

## Prerequisites

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/Neo-Aditya-s-personal-projects/ScoutRadioz-Data-Calculation/issues/new/choose), assuming one does not already exist, and describe your concern. Note you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) for this.

## Describe your issue

Clearly describe the issue:

- If it is a bug, please describe how to **reproduce** it. If possible, attach a complete example which demonstrates the error. Please also state what you **expected** to happen instead of the error.
- If you propose a change or addition, try to give an **example** how the improved code could look like or how to use it.
- If you found a compilation error, please tell us which **compiler** (version and operating system) you used and paste the (relevant part of) the error messages to the ticket.

For questions, feature or support requests, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/Neo-Aditya-s-personal-projects/ScoutRadioz-Data-Calculation/discussions/new).

## Notes

   If you add or change a feature, please also add unit tests if you know how to or are able to.

   To run this program run:

   ```
   gcc Main.java -o InsertName -lSDL2 -lm
   ./InsertName 
   ```
   
   Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.

## Wanted

The following areas really need contribution:

- Improving the time complexity
- Documentation
- Making the program work upon all platforms and IDEs
